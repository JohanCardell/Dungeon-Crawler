# Dungeon Crawler
A simple console based dungeon crawler game

A couple of bugs went through unnoticed during the final crunch before deadline.
If I were to revisit the code, beside squashing bugs, I would remake the world map, add more levels, add more interactable objects and improve the fog of war.
